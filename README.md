# Superstore-Reporting
This project aims to show capabilities of Alteryx software on the Kaggle data named "Superstore".

## Iterative Macro used in the "Superstore" project.
This macro uses iterative process to find the nearest location using spatial analytics. This macro aims to solve the "Traveling Salesman Problem", but it needs an upstream macro that will run this process for other combination of starting points, which is further solved in "Shortest Route Batch" Macro.
